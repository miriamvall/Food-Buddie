Design project for the [Human-Computer Interaction: Principles and Design](https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/IC1007?l=en) course at [Kungliga Tekniska HÃ¶gskolan](https://www.kth.se/en) in Stockholm, Sweden. 

The goal is to design an intuitive and user-friendly interface which follows the principles of good UX design.

It involves the design of an interface for an app which helps owners of small and medium grocery shops to improve the management of their stock, and function in a more sustainable way.

## The interface allows the user to:

* Enter their username and password to access their individual profile

* See and manage their stock (individually or by category)

  * View which products are at risk of expiring soon
  * View rankings of most and least sold products by category or by individual product
  * See how the sales have developed over time- yearly, monthly, weekly
  
* Choose how to dispose of expired or almost expired products: throw away, donate, recycle...

* See a map with the nearest donating/recycling spots

* Log out

## Contents of the project

* Prototype (as a Principle .prd file) made with [Sketch graphics editor](https://www.sketch.com/), and also a video of it to display how the interface would be used.
* Group project report files that encompass the whole design process, from early brainstorming to requirements specification, including testing on users and interviews to potential stakeholders.
